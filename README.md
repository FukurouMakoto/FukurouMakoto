<p align="center">I began my coding journey in the middle of the 2020 Corona Virus pandemic, taking advantage of my sudden lack of work to pursue my goals of becoming a software engineer and front-end web developer. 
My goal is to be able to come out of the global situation with the skills necessary to make my career change and get into the programming field. </p>


<p align="center">Currently working on improving my overall coding knowledge and wanting to take that next step to intermediate programmer.</p> 

<p align="center">Currently learning how to use Github for future projects, as well as side-learning some Cyber Security while also working on web design.</p>

<p align="center">Currently looking for any Open Source Projects I might be able to contribute to, especially those with regards to web design, cyber security, software engineering, really anything! I want to get my feet wet and get my code out there! </p>

<p align="center">Currently looking for anyone who can offer mentorship or help me to reach that next level, especially with regard to using Github or moving to that Intermediate stage in my coding journey.</p>

<p align="center">Feel free to talk to me about anything really as long as its not politics lol. 
I'm especially open to helping anyone with anything I can, whether with coding frameworks I know or even life advice. </p>

<p align="center">Feel free to shoot me a message with anything you might want to know! I do not have any form of social media as I strongly condemn the practice and platform.</p>

<p align="center">Fun Fact: 
My username is spelled 梟誠. 
梟 means owl (hence the beaufiful bird at the top).
誠 means Truth and Honesty.</p> 

<p align="center">I chose this name because I wish to be as wise as the old owl, and because I want to approach everything I do and everyone I talk to with simple, straight honesty. Both are tenets I live my life by. </p>
