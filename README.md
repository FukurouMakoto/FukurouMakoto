<p align="center">I started learning to program in the middle of the 2020 Corona lockdowns, taking advantage of my sudden lack of work to pursue my goals of becoming a software engineer.
During this time, I also began to learn Linux, Systems Administration, Networking, Cyber-Security, and just about anything IT . </p>


<p align="center">Currently working as a Lvl.1 Field Technician w/Junior SysAdmin responsiblities while also working on my programming skills.</p> 

<p align="center">Currently learning how to use Github for future projects, as well as learning some cyber security, devops & software engineering on the side.</p>

<p align="center">Currently looking for any Open Source Projects I might be able to contribute to, especially those with regards to cyber security, software engineering, really anything. I want to get my feet wet and get my code out there. </p>
 
<p align="center">Currently looking for anyone who can offer mentorship or help me to reach that next level, especially with regard to using Github or taking my programming skills to the next level.</p>

<p align="center">Feel free to talk to me about anything. 
I'm especially open to helping anyone with anything I can, whether with programming frameworks I know or even life advice. </p>
